I have implemented putc(), puts(), gets(), clrscr() and update_cursor() functions
Most of them are the one found in C language, so theyr name is pretty straigth forward, 
and what they do. 

One of the basic funtion is putc. Everywhere I'm using row, col and position as global variables to keep track of where I'm putting the string.
In putc, I first took care of line wrapping [line 23]
then, we proced computing the position. We put there the character, and use a white on black background character.
We are updating the position of the cursor, as well the column.

puts - we are printing char by char, until we have the null byte.
also we keep track of any newline char, and we increse the row by one, and reset the column.

clrscr - we just print and empty char all over :D

gets - using a function defined in kbd.c, getchar, we store 32 charcters one by one in an array.
also, it's cool to enable a echo, and after capturing a char we output it. once again putc comes in handy.
