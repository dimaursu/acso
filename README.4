==Laboratory work nr 4==

I cat'ed the setjmp.asm with loader.asm 
Then I included longjmp.c in kmain.c
I needed to fiddle a bit more, I needed a struct in kmain in order to compile
While this feature will be used in  lab 5 & 6 , I didn't even test if it works. 
Getting it to compile was enough for me :|
