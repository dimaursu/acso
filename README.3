Laboratory work nr3

In this laboratory work, I modified the makefile so it will compile the files from cmd/ 
The rest of the story is simpler, we just create a file cmd/cmd_hello.c; and call the function from kmain.c
I was supposed to parse the input to identify the commands, but I was in a hurry, and I forgot.
